# Perception - the five senses

The five senses are the primary means by which humans perceive and
experience their environment. They include sight, hearing, smell,
taste, and touch. Sight is the ability to see objects and colors
through light waves that enter our eyes and stimulate specialized
cells called rods and cones in the retina. Hearing involves the
perception of sound by detecting vibrations in the air using hair-like
structures called cilia in the inner ear. Smell is the ability to
perceive odors through a network of olfactory receptors that detect
chemical compounds present in scents. Taste is the sensation of flavor
and texture, which involves the interaction between taste buds on our
tongue and various molecules present in food or drink. Touch is the
perception of pressure, temperature, and other tactile stimuli through
a network of nerve endings that detect these signals from our skin and
muscles. Together, these five senses enable humans to interact with
their environment, learn about it, and adapt to different situations
and experiences.
