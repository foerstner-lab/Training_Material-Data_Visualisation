# Introduction to data visualisation

## Perception - the five senses

The five senses are the primary means by which humans perceive and
experience their environment. They include sight, hearing, smell,
taste, and touch. Sight is the ability to see objects and colors
through light waves that enter our eyes and stimulate specialized
cells called rods and cones in the retina. Hearing involves the
perception of sound by detecting vibrations in the air using hair-like
structures called cilia in the inner ear. Smell is the ability to
perceive odors through a network of olfactory receptors that detect
chemical compounds present in scents. Taste is the sensation of flavor
and texture, which involves the interaction between taste buds on our
tongue and various molecules present in food or drink. Touch is the
perception of pressure, temperature, and other tactile stimuli through
a network of nerve endings that detect these signals from our skin and
muscles. Together, these five senses enable humans to interact with
their environment, learn about it, and adapt to different situations
and experiences.

- sight (stimulus: light)
- smell (stimulus: chemical substance)
- touch (stimulus: presure / temperatur)
- taste (stimulus: chemical substance)
- hearing (stimulus: sound = presure)


## Encoding / decoding of data during visualisation

**Data encoding** refers to the process of representing numerical or
categorical information in a way that can be easily understood by
humans through visual means such as graphs, charts, or maps. During
data visualization, this encoded information is translated into
different types of visual representations like line plots, bar charts,
scatter plots, and pie charts, among others.

**Data decoding** refers to the process of interpreting these visual
representations to extract meaningful insights from the data. This
involves understanding how the various elements within a graph or
chart are related and what patterns they may reveal about the
underlying data. It helps forming a mental model of the visualised
data.

### Features / Attributes

Features can be
- categorical / qualitative
  - Nominal (e.g. eye color, type of bike )
  - Ordinal (e.g. very bad, bad, good, very good)
- numerical / quantitative
  - Discrete (e.g. number of people)
  - Continuous (e.g. height of person, weight of a ship , distance between two locations)

## Aesthetics

Aesthetics - anciet greek αἴσθησις;
